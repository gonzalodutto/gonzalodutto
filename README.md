Hi there, I am an Italian-Argentine developer living in the Netherlands, I have a background in Architecture (of those who design and build houses) and I also have 10 years of experience in business related to the sale of construction materials. But then I decided to change careers to the world of software because I believe that knowledge of software is equivalent to doing magic and I like to create creative functional things with it.

My programming journey started with the JavaScript full stack side, and in it I have learned technologies such as: **JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React + Redux, Bootstrap, NodeJs, PostgreSQL (+ Sequelize)**. Result of this first adventure in the software, I created my first baby project: www.bukloo.com (a webshop that helps promote the circular economy, with some very interesting features such as its dynamic invoice, which I would love to explain to you if you request it).
